_A Machine Learning + NLP powered solution for accurate forecasting, smarter stocking decisions, and intelligent business insights._

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an end-to-end **Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management System** built using **Meta’s Prophet model** and an **NLP chatbot**.  
It predicts future demand, calculates optimal inventory levels, and allows users to ask natural-language questions for instant insights.

The system is designed to be:

- 🔍 **Accurate** (Prophet handles seasonality, trends, holidays)
- 🧠 **Intelligent** (NLP chatbot answers forecast-related queries)
- 📉 **Cost-efficient** (EOQ, safety stock & reorder point logic)
- 🧱 **Production-ready** (clean, modular code ideal for real-world use)
